 * @package  Wordpress_auth
 *
 * Use Wordpress installation as authentication source.
 * Wordpress Roles are mappee to Gallery groups
 *
 * The module comes with two drivers:
 * wordpressdb: Connect directly to the wordpress database defined in
 * $config['wordpress_auth']['params']['wp_database'] and authenticate
 *
 * wordpressfile: Load the entire Wordpress codebase and use Wordpress API
 * functions to authenticate users. The path to the Wordpress basedir must be
 * defined in $config['wordpress_auth']['params']['path'] and this file must
 * be included from the gallery index.php file
 *
 * wordpressdb is fastest but does only work with straight Wordpress database.
 * If other authentications plugins have been added to wordpress, then the
 * wordpressfile driver must be used.
