Gallery3 PAM version 0.1 released 2010-08-12

ABOUT
  Allows users to login by using external authentication methods.

  Note: I chose not to use the existing LDAP module because it did not allow me
  to use both local Gallery accounts along with the LDAP accounts.

  This module replaces the default login link on the user_menu_login. This
  works for the ajax login but to use the html you need to go to /pam ... I do
  not know enough about kohana to know how to use the /login url without
  removing the gallery/controller/login.php file.

INSTALLATION
  Copy the pam folder to the gallery3 modules folder.

CONFIGURATION
  Add plugins to the plugin folder to enable alternative authentication methods.

  Edit the config/config.php file to override defaults.

  $plugin_path = '';
  The default path is pam/plugins. You can put them anywhere and use this to set
  the absolute path.

  $plugins = array('gallery');
  By default the plugin folder is scanned and whatever folders are found are
  added to the plugin   array. By  using this setting you can specify what
  plugins to include and in what order they will be used.

  $create_account = true;
  By default this is set to false. Set this to true if you want to
  automatically create accounts. This assumes the plugin will have a
  getAccount() method that will return at the very least: name,full_name,email

  Note:
  Two plugins are included in the pam_plugin folder. Copy a plugin to the
  plugin folder to make it available to the PAM module.

  mock: will authenticate any matching name/password pair. ex. user/user and if
  $create_account is true then an account will be created using the name. The
  fullname will be "Mock {the name used}" and the email will be set to "{the
  name used}@email.com"

  ad: this is a plugin to authenticate a user via an Active Directory domain
  controller. It uses the class adLDAP (http://adldap.sourceforge.net/) and
  assumes that your PHP environment has the LDAP exensions loaded. This
  plugin has included the adLDAP class version 2.1. I've not tested with later
  versions.

USE
  Login as admin and go to the Gallery Modules page. Check the PAM module and
  update. The PAM module will replace the "Login" link so that the PAM module
  will be used instead of the core Login.

  By default the "gallery" plugin is in the plugin folder. This allows
  authentication via the core identity. You should be able to logout and then
  login again.

PROBLEMS
  If you are not able to login just remove the PAM folder from the modules and
  refresh your page. Or you can go to the default login by going to {your site
  url}/login.

  Submit an issue at http://github.com/jimsloan/gallery3-pam/issues or email
  me.

FUTURE
  I will be adding a OpenID plugin soon.

  By using the Mock plugin as an example you should be able to create a
  connector/plugin to any existing database or web service that will
  authenticate user credentials.
