This is very, very rough sample code for how to do some Java REST
requests. To run this code:

1) Edit Demo.java and set the BASE_URL to your Gallery3 install.
2) Edit USERNAME and PASSWORD as appropriate
3) In a shell, do "sh build.sh"
4) In a shell, do "sh run.sh"

Note that there is NO error checking, so if something goes wrong
you'll have to debug it.
