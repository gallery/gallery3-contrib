/**
 * @package  Cache
 *
 * Cache settings, defined as arrays, or "groups". If no group name is
 * used when loading the cache library, the group named "default" will be used.
 *
 * Each group can be used independently, and multiple groups can be used at once.
 *
 * Group Options:
 *  driver   - Cache backend driver. Kohana comes with file, database, and memcache drivers.
 *              > File cache is fast and reliable, but requires many filesystem lookups.
 *              > Database cache can be used to cache items remotely, but is slower.
 *              > Memcache is very high performance, but prevents cache tags from being used.
 *
 *  params   - Driver parameters, specific to each driver.
 *
 *  lifetime - Default lifetime of caches in seconds. By default caches are stored for
 *             thirty minutes. Specific lifetime can also be set when creating a new cache.
 *             Setting this to 0 will never automatically delete caches.
 *
 *  prefix   - Adds a prefix to all keys and tags. This can have a severe performance impact.
 *
