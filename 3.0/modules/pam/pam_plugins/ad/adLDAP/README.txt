I'd appreciate any improvements or additions to be submitted back
to benefit the entire community :)

Works with both PHP 4 and PHP 5

I generally install libraries and classes in a folder in the document root
called "includes/". If you want to use somewhere else, just edit the
include directives in the scripts.

The examples should be pretty self explanatory. If you require more
information, please visit http://adldap.sourceforge.net/
