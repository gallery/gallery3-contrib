2011-01-20: Version 2

Added features
--------------
- upload select types of images only (thumbs/resizes/fullsizes)
- schedule initial synchronisation during gallery shutdown to prevent browser hanging on large installations
- schedule upload of new items after upload during gallery shutdown to prevent browser hanging on slower
  uplink connections (dsl home servers, etc)

Bug fixes
---------
- added verification routine to verify entered bucket name and access credentials to avoid false hope
- added check in module's installed to prevent installation should curl not be installed, as the s3 library
  depends on it
- resolved some issues with cooliris slideshow player not working correctly, due to browsers blocking ajax calls
  for images since it's cross-domain. the module will now allow the browser to pull the images from the local server
  to prevent any xdr issues
- fixed problems moving items around. the module now moves content around the s3 bucket to coincide with the local
  filesystem and g3's perception of items and albums
- resolved problems with odd characters in filenames. this actually wasn't to do with odd characters but to do with
  the filename being escaped twice, causing file not found errors

2010-11-26: Version 1
