    You cannot have both active at the same time.<br /><br />
    If you decide to show annotations below the photo but they are displayed below the comments section (or any other data),
    please download and install the <a href=\"http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3:Modules:moduleorder\">Module order module</a>.") ?></p>
